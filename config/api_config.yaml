  # SMapper API

  **SMapper API** is the main interface for interacting with the handheld device. It provides endpoints to:

  * List and inspect installed sensors
  * Monitor ROS topics in real time
  * Start, stop, and restart device services (including ROS nodes and launch files)
  * Record and manage ROS bag files
  * Check system status and metadata
  * Trigger system-level actions like rebooting or powering off the onboard computer (WIP)

  For the device documentation and detailed usage, visit the /docs endpoint
